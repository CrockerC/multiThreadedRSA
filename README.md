# multiThreadedRSA
Implements RSA using pyCryptodome and multithreading

While ususally it is advised that RSA is used only to exchange secret AES keys, I found it an interesting exercise to multithread RSA encryption and decryption

The object also contains a multithreaded RSA key generator which would be much more useful

File also includes functions for single threaded RSA encryption/decryption
